## Getting Started

### What is RemitEasy?

RemitEasy is a decentralized platform that lets you send money across borders instantly using blockchain technology. Unlike traditional services like Western Union or MoneyGram, RemitEasy:

- **Costs less than $0.01 per transaction** (vs $5-50)
- **Completes in under 5 seconds** (vs 3-7 days)
- **Works 24/7** (no business hours)
- **No hidden fees** (transparent pricing)
- **Secure** (blockchain-based, non-custodial)

### What You Need

1. **A Solana Wallet** - We recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)
2. **Some USDC** - The stablecoin we use for transfers
